CSH Drink is an app for iOS and macOS that allows members of Computer Science House (CSH) to drop drinks the internet connected vending machines 
that are at CSH.

## Current Features
Currently it is possible to see what drinks are in stock and drop one if you have enough drink credits

## Future Features
I have a lot of places I would like to take this app in the future. For starters, I would like to make a watchOS app with the same functionality as the
iOS app. I would also like to make it possible to drop drinks using Siri. Beyond that, I would like to add a today widget so that a user could drop drinks
without having to open the app.
